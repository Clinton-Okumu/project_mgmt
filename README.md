Tired of project management tools that feel bloated, overly complex, or expensive for your indie development needs? This project aims to provide a focused, streamlined experience, giving you **everything you need and nothing you don't**.

Built specifically with solo developers and small, agile indie teams in mind, it prioritizes simplicity, speed, and the core features that help you ship your projects.

## Key Features üöÄ

*   **Task Management:** Simple yet powerful task tracking with priorities, deadlines, assignees, and progress monitoring.
*   **Milestones:** Define and track major project checkpoints to visualize progress and celebrate achievements.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress indicators (like burndown charts or completion percentages) and basic statistics to keep you motivated and informed.
*   **Secure Storage:** Safely store project-specific sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and configurations. (*Security is paramount for this feature.*)
*   **Data Export:** Export your project data anytime in common formats like CSV, JSON, or Markdown for flexibility and backup.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Invite team members, assign tasks, and collaborate on projects together seamlessly.

## Target Audience üéØ

*   Solo Indie Developers
*   Small Indie Game Studios
*   Freelance Developers
*   Small Software Teams needing a no-fuss PM tool

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Frontend:** React (Vite/CRA) - For a modern, component-based, and interactive user interface.
*   **Backend:** Go (Golang) - For high performance, concurrency, reliability, and simple deployment.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL - A robust, reliable relational database with great support for structured data and JSONB flexibility.

## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Git
*   Go (Check `go.mod` for required version)
*   Node.js & npm/yarn (Check `package.json` for required version)
*   PostgreSQL (Running instance accessible)
*   Make (Optional, if a Makefile is used for common commands)
*   Docker & Docker Compose (Optional, for easy PostgreSQL setup)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository Link]
    cd [repository-folder-name]
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Go):**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Or your backend directory name
    
    # Install dependencies
    go mod tidy
    
    # Configure environment variables
    # Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your details
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.
    
    # Setup database (Run migrations - command depends on migration tool used)
    # Example: migrate -database "$DATABASE_URL" -path ./migrations up 
    
    # Run the backend server
    go run main.go
    ```
    The backend API should now be running (typically on a port like `8080`).

3.  **Frontend Setup (React):**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Or your frontend directory name
    
    # Install dependencies
    npm install 
    # or
    # yarn install
    
    # Configure environment variables (if needed)
    # Often involves setting the API endpoint URL
    # Check for a .env.development or similar file
    
    # Start the frontend development server
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    The frontend should now be running (typically on `http://localhost:3000` or similar) and connecting to your local backend API.

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have a PostgreSQL server running.
    *   Create a database for the project.
    *   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the backend's `.env` file to point to your database.
    *   Run the database migrations as mentioned in the Backend Setup.
    *   *(Optional)* Consider adding a `docker-compose.yml` file to the project root to easily spin up a PostgreSQL container for local development.

### Usage

Once both backend and frontend are running:

1.  Open your browser to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Register a new account or log in.
3.  Create your first project.
4.  Start adding tasks, milestones, and inviting team members!
